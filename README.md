## Objective
Build a mobile application using Expo and React Native that communicates with the real world. This "Weather Forecaster" app searches the "Current Weather Data" in the OpenWeather, fetching live data from a public API and displaying it in a sleek, searchable interface.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
    - You can use any editor, VSC is recommended for this project. You can download from [VS Code official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    
- **Node.js**
    - This project uses **Node.js 20 (LTS line)** to run the local development server and manage dependencies. You can download from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- **Node Package Manager (npm)**: Version 11.6.2 or higher (comes bundled with Node.js)
    - This project use npm to manage the libraries for the project, this comes pre-bundled with Node.js.

- **Expo**
    - This project uses **Expo** to build and run the app on Android and iOS devices.
    - It simplifies setup by handling native configuration and build tools automatically

- **Expo Go** (Optional)
    - **Expo Go** is a mobile app that allows you to quickly preview and test React Native apps on your physical device.
    - It is useful for rapid development without needing a full Android or iOS build setup.
    - You can download from the [Expo Go official website](https://expo.dev/go).
    - The following step is **only needed if you are creating a new React Native project using Expo Go**:

    ```bash
    npx create-expo-app@latest --template
    ```

- **Android Studio** (Optional)
    - **Android Studio** is required to run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.
    - It provides the Android SDK, emulator, and build tools needed for React Native development.
    - You can download from the [Android Studio official website](https://developer.android.com/studio).


 *Note: To check version installed in your terminal or bash:*
 ```bash
 node -v
 npm -v
 npx -v
 ```

### Installation & Environment Setup
1. Go to your terminal or bash, navigate to the folder you want to save the project:

```bash
cd <Folder_Name>
```
2. Clone the Repository
In the folder you want to save your project in, run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Angel43v3r/AD340-ProfilePictureUpdater.git
```

3. Navigate to the app folder:

```
cd AD340-ProfilePictureUpdater
```

4. If you haven't yet, install Expo:
 ```bash
    npx create-expo-app@latest --template
```
#### -OR-
```bash
   npx create-expo-app@latest <app-name>
```

Next, choose a template, I choose `Default`
Lastly, name your app
*Note this will automatically run npm install and install all the needed dependencies for Expo*

#### Install dependencies:
```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```
*This is for async storage*

5. Navigate to the folder
```
cd <Folder_Name>
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npx expo start
```

7. Once the server starts, **Expo Dev Tool** will open in your browser and a QR code will be displayed in the terminal.

    You can then choose one of the following options:
    - Scan **QR code** (Recommended):
        - This opens the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device. Make sure that Expo Go app is installed on your phone.
        - If the QR code does not scan, make sure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
    - use **Android Studio** Emulator:
        - Make sure the Android Studio is running.
        - You need to open the **Android Studio** in your server, then navigate and open the project folder root. Make sure Android studio is installed. 
        - Press `a -> Android emulator` in your bash or terminal.
    - use **iOS simulator (Mac Only)**:
        - Press i -> iOS simulator (Mac only).
    - Run on **Web Browser**:
        - Press w -> open web

8. Open the project in your preferred code editor such as VS Code.

## Running Test (OPTIONAL)
I did not implement a test on this project. This is how to setup a Vitest as the test runner.

### Installation
If not already installed, in the `TheDynamicDataExplorer` or `root` folder:
```bash
npm install -D vitest
```

### Test Setup
Make sure your `package.json` should include:
```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
},
"vitest": {
    "include": ["test/**/*.test.ts"]
},
"devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^2.0.0"
}
```

Make sure your test folder structure should look like below:
```
ProfilePictureUpdater/
├── app/
│   ├── _layout.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
├── test/
│   └── index.test.ts
```

### Run Test
In your bash or terminal, navigate to the React Native root folder (TheDailyGrindTodoApp):
```bash
npm test
```

**-OR-** run tests once (CI mode):
```bash
npx vitest run
```
